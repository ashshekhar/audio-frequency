# Audio Frequency

In this project, he C chord recording is stored in a file named `Cchord.mat`
This file contains two variables:
```
y: signal from recording
fs: sampling frequency
```
## Concepts Involved
In the final plot, notice that y is periodic, but it's not a simple sine wave. It's made up of multiple sine waves with different frequencies.

A Fourier transform is used to gain information about the frequency content of the signal. The location of the dominant frequencies will show what notes are contained in the chord.
