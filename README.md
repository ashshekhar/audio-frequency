# Audio Frequency

In this project, he C chord recording is stored in a file named `Cchord.mat`
This file contains two variables:
```
y: signal from recording
fs: sampling frequency
```
## Concepts Involved

1. A `Fourier transform` is used to gain information about the frequency content of the signal. The location of the dominant frequencies will show what notes are contained in the chord.

2. In addition, the `y value` in `final-graph.png` is periodic, but it's not a simple sine wave. It is infact made up of multiple sine waves with different frequencies.
